NanoMQ MQTT Broker (NanoMQ) is a lightweight and blazing-fast MQTT Broker for the IoT Edge platform. 

NanoMQ bases on NNG's asynchronous I/O threading model, with an extension of MQTT support in the protocol layer and reworked transport layer, plus an enhanced asynchronous IO mechanism maximizing the overall capacity.

NanoMQ fully supports MQTT V3.1.1 and MQTT V5.0.

For more information, please visit [NanoMQ homepage](https://nanomq.io/).

## Features

- Cost-effective on an embedded platform;
- Fully base on native POSIX. High Compatibility;
- Pure C implementation. High portability;
- Fully asynchronous I/O and multi-threading;
- Good support for SMP;
- Low latency & High handling capacity;

## Get Started

### Run NanoMQ using Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name nanomq -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8883:8883 emqx/nanomq:latest
```

### More installation options

If you prefer to install and manage NanoMQ yourself, you can download the lastest version from [nanomq.io/downloads](https://nanomq.io/downloads).

#### Run NanoMQ:

```bash
nanomq start
## or run nanomq with a specified configuration file
nanomq start --conf <config_file>
```



## Build From Source

NanoMQ dedicates to delivering a simple but powerful Messaging Hub on various edge platforms.

With this being said, NanoMQ can run on different architectures such like x86_64 and ARM with minor migration efforts.

To build NanoMQ, requires a C99 compatible compiler and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) (version 3.13 or newer). 

- It is recommended to compile with `Ninja`:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/emqx/nanomq.git
  cd nanomq
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -G Ninja ..
  ninja
  ```

- Or compile with `make`:

  ``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/emqx/nanomq.git 
  cd nanomq
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. 
  make
  ```

### Build option

There are some configuration options specified using CMake defines in addition to the standard options like `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`:

- `-DNNG_ENABLE_QUIC=ON`: to build NanoMQ with QUIC bridging feature
- `-DNNG_ENABLE_TLS=ON`: to build with TLS support. (Need to install  [mbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org) in advance)
- `-DBUILD_CLIENT=OFF`: to disable nanomq tools client suite  (including pub / sub / conn )
- `-DBUILD_ZMQ_GATEWAY=ON`: to build `nanomq_cli` with zeromq gateway tool
- `-DBUILD_NFTP=ON`: to build `nanomq_cli` with nftp client
- `-DBUILD_DDS_PROXY=ON`: to build `nanomq_cli` with dds client ( proxy / sub / pub )
- `-DBUILD_BENCH=ON`: to build  `nanomq_cli` mqtt bench
- ` -DENABLE_JWT=ON`: to build  JWT dependency for http server
- `-DNNG_ENABLE_SQLITE=ON`: to build nanomq with sqlite support
- `-DBUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON`: to build nanomq as a static library
- `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`: to build nanomq as a shared library
- `-DDEBUG=ON`: to enable debug flag
- `-DASAN=ON`: to enable sanitizer
- `-DDEBUG_TRACE=ON`: to enable ptrace (ptrace is a mechanism that allows one process to “trace” the execution of another process. The tracer is able to
  pause execution, and inspect and modify memory and registers in the tracee process)

## Community

Some quotes from NNG's maintainer --- Garrett:
I’m very excited about the synergy between the NanoMQ and NNG projects, and grateful for sponsorship that NNG has received from the NanoMQ team. The NanoMQ team has been able to push NNG's envelope, and the collaboration has already yielded substantial improvements for both projects. Further, the cooperation between these two project will make MQTT and SP (nanomsg) protocols easy to use within a single project as well as other capabilities (such as websockets, HTTPS clients and servers), greatly expanding the toolset within easy reach of the IoT developer. Further this comes without the usual licensing or portability/embeddability challenges that face other projects. Additional planned collaborative work will further expand on these capabilities to the benefit of our shared communities.
